                                I’m Ashutosh Goyal (Ashu), a Computer Science Engineering student who believes
                                technology should solve real-world problems — not just exist on paper. I was born on
                                <b>14 May 2007</b> in <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gwalior"
                                        target="_blank">Gwalior</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=india"
                                        target="_blank">India</a></b>, and from a young age I was fascinated by how
                                things worked. I loved opening gadgets, pressing every button, and asking why something
                                behaved the way it did — that curiosity grew into a passion for building.
                                <br><br>

                                I enjoy creating systems that combine software, hardware, and intelligence, especially
                                in areas like safety, accessibility, and social impact. I’ve worked with Python, Java,
                                JavaScript, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi, and I’m deeply interested in AI/ML, computer
                                vision, robotics, IoT, and system design. I’m particularly fascinated by how AI models
                                like YOLO work internally — and how low-level concepts turn into real applications.
                                <br><br>

                                Hackathons are where I thrive. I like solving meaningful Indian real-world problems —
                                especially around women’s safety and public security. I don’t just aim to build demos; I
                                focus on feasible, scalable solutions with solid engineering and thoughtful UI/UX.
                                <br><br>

                                I started coding because I wanted to build things that actually matter. Over time, I
                                realized that great technology isn’t about showing off features — it’s about <b>solving
                                    real problems</b> in simple, thoughtful ways. Coding became the tool that lets me
                                turn ideas into <b>working systems</b> — whether that means improving accessibility,
                                designing better experiences, or building tools that quietly make life easier. I’m
                                constantly experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and <i>learning from every
                                    mistake</i>.
                                <br><br>

                                Today, I’m exploring advanced CS topics and considering a Master’s in Computer Science
                                at Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology. My long-term goal is to build
                                impactful products and startups that blend
                                innovation, engineering depth, and social responsibility. Outside of coding, I enjoy
                                <i>[hobby or interest]</i> and love exploring ideas that challenge how technology should
                                serve people. At the end of the day, I believe <b>good ideas deserve to become real</b>
                                — and code is how I make that happen.
                            </p>
                            <h1 class="h-text">Hobbies</h1>
                            <p id="hobbie-text">My hobbies revolve around exploring and building with technology. I
                                enjoy coding in my free time, experimenting with new programming concepts, AI models,
                                and system-level tools to understand how things work beneath the surface. I like
                                participating in hackathons and technical challenges, where I can turn ideas into real,
                                working projects under pressure. I’m also interested in robotics and hardware tinkering,
                                especially working with microcontrollers, sensors, and automation systems.

                                Beyond coding, I enjoy learning about emerging technologies, improving UI/UX design for
                                smoother user experiences, and constantly pushing myself to create solutions that are
                                both innovative and practical. I spend time reading documentation, watching research
                                breakdowns, and trying to replicate real-world systems just to see how they’re built.
                                These activities help me think more like an engineer — not just a programmer.

                                I also believe balance matters. When I’m not building something new, I enjoy slowing
                                down, reflecting on ideas, and exploring creative sides of technology — whether it’s
                                design, storytelling, or brainstorming product concepts. These hobbies keep me curious,
                                improve how I think, and constantly remind me why I love creating things that genuinely
                                make life easier.
                                <br><br>
                                <!-- <br><br> -->
                                I also enjoy spending time with stories — both books and films. I’ve read titles like
                                <b>The Fault in Our Stars</b>, <b>Harry Potter</b>, and <b>Twilight</b>, and each of
                                them taught me something different. Some talk about love and loss, others about courage,
                                friendship, and the choices we make. I like how books slow things down and give space to
                                think, imagine, and feel — almost like stepping into another world for a while.
                                <br><br>
                                Movies and shows are another big part of how I relax and stay inspired. I really enjoy
                                watching <b>The Family Man</b>, <b>Stranger Things</b>, <b>Dhurandhar</b>, and many
                                others. I like stories that mix emotions, suspense, and a little bit of chaos — the type
                                that keeps you thinking even after it ends. Sometimes I pay attention to the plot, and
                                sometimes I focus on how the creators built the scenes, timing, and characters.
                                <br><br>
                                For me, reading and watching good stories isn’t just entertainment. It helps me
                                understand different perspectives, learn how people think, and recognize how powerful
                                storytelling can be. In a way, it also influences my work in tech — reminding me that
                                behind every system, app, or product, there are real people with real emotions and
                                experiences. And if technology can respect that, it becomes more meaningful.

                                As you already know me from the home page, I’m <b>Ashutosh Goyal</b>. I believe
                                technology is not just about circuits, code, and screens — it’s about human experience.
                                Great technology disappears into the background. It doesn’t scream for attention. It
                                simply works — beautifully, quietly, and meaningfully. That idea has shaped the way I
                                think, build, and learn.
                                <br><br>

                                From a young age, I wasn’t satisfied with just using things. I wanted to understand why
                                they worked, and more importantly, how they could be better. That curiosity led me into
                                a world where software, hardware, and intelligence come together. Today, I love working
                                with <b>Python, Java, JavaScript, ESP32, Raspberry Pi and Web Development</b> — not
                                because they are tools,
                                but because they help turn imagination into reality. My curiosity pushes me toward
                                <b>AI/ML, computer vision, IoT, robotics, and system design</b>, where each idea has the
                                potential to transform someone’s everyday life.
                                <br><br>

                                Hackathons excite me because they feel like small versions of the future: limited time,
                                bold ideas, and a clear purpose. I don’t build just to “show something working.” I aim
                                to build things that are <b>thoughtful, scalable, and reliable</b> — systems that
                                respect both engineering and the people who will eventually use them. Technology, if
                                done right, should feel natural. Almost obvious.
                                <br><br>

                                I’m continuing this journey at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=juet"
                                    target="_blank"><i>Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology</i></a>,
                                constantly exploring how ideas evolve from simple sketches into real products. My
                                ambition is to build things that matter — products and startups that combine <b>design,
                                    engineering, and purpose</b>. I don’t want to create technology that simply exists.
                                I want to create technology that means something.
                                <br><br>

                                I break things. I rebuild them. I learn. And I repeat. That cycle is where true progress
                                happens. I believe every detail matters — from how a button feels to how fast a system
                                responds. Small decisions shape big experiences, and that mindset drives the way I think
                                about building.
                                <br><br>

                                When I’m not coding, I recharge through stories and worlds that inspire imagination. I
                                enjoy gaming — titles like <b>Fortnite, Valorant, GTA 5, God of War, Cricket 25</b> and
                                many more. These aren’t just games to me. They’re lessons in design, storytelling,
                                emotion, and precision. They remind me that technology can be powerful, but it should
                                also be human.
                                <br><br>

                                I try to live in a space between curiosity and creation — constantly learning,
                                constantly questioning, constantly building. Because I believe something deeply: the
                                world doesn’t move forward by accident. It moves forward when people decide to build
                                something better than what existed before.

                                In the end, I don’t just want to write code. I want to create experiences. I want to
                                craft systems that feel intuitive, honest, and meaningful. And if even one project I
                                build makes life easier for someone — then the effort was worth it. That’s the kind of
                                impact I want to leave.

                            <b>Where I Learn From</b>
                            I strongly believe consistent learning matters more than shortcuts. A lot of my concepts and
                            clarity come from practical experimentation, documentation — and great learning communities
                            online.
                            <br><br>

                            Some YouTube channels that shaped my foundation:

                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Apna College</b> — fundamentals, DSA basics, structured learning</li>

                            These channels helped me understand things faster — but I always extend them with my own
                            projects and experiments.

                            I actively look for challenges where ideas can turn into working systems.

                            <ul>

                                I’m <b>Manya Chugh</b>, born on <b>18 July 2007</b> in <b>Gwalior, India</b>.
                                I’m currently studying Computer Science at <b>Amity University</b>, and I love learning
                                how technology,
                                design, and creativity come together to make meaningful experiences.

                                <br><br>

                                I’m someone who learns fast, adapts quickly, and enjoys adding a sense of confidence and
                                style into the
                                things I build. I like systems that feel organized, clean, and intuitive — technology
                                should not confuse
                                people, it should quietly guide them.

                                <br><br>

                                While I work with tech, I also focus a lot on the human side of it — how something
                                looks, how it flows,
                                and how it makes a person feel while using it. That natural mix of creativity +
                                structure is where I’m
                                most comfortable.

                                <br><br>

                                I am fluent in <b>Hindi, English, and Punjabi</b>, which helps me communicate and
                                collaborate with
                                different kinds of people easily. I enjoy planning, ideating, and making sure projects
                                feel polished and
                                thoughtfully built.

                                <br><br>

                                I like collaborating on projects that matter — especially those that help people,
                                improve safety,
                                or make everyday life smoother. I prefer working in calm, focused environments where
                                ideas evolve
                                step-by-step instead of rushing.

                                <br><br>

                                In short — I’m curious, confident, creative, and always looking for thoughtful ways to
                                grow.

                                I’m someone who believes that hobbies aren’t just activities — they’re windows into who
                                we are,
                                how we think, and what truly inspires us. Over time, I’ve realized that the things I
                                enjoy
                                are deeply connected to creativity, emotions, curiosity, and learning.

                                <br><br>

                                One of the most meaningful parts of my life is <b>writing poetry</b>.
                                For me, poetry isn’t just about rhymes — it’s about capturing feelings that are
                                difficult
                                to say out loud. Sometimes it’s a thought, sometimes a memory, sometimes a moment that
                                passes
                                too quickly — and writing lets me hold onto it.

                                <br><br>

                                Poetry allows me to slow down, reflect, and understand myself better.
                                It helps me express strength, vulnerability, love, confusion, excitement — everything.
                                Every poem feels like a small conversation with myself, quietly shaping the way I see
                                the world.

                                <br><br>

                                Along with writing, I love <b>reading books</b>.
                                Books give me space to escape reality, but they also push me to think deeper.
                                They introduce me to different lives, cultures, emotions, and worlds — some magical,
                                some painfully real, and some beautifully simple.

                                <br><br>

                                When I read, I don’t just follow the story —
                                I notice how characters grow, how authors build feelings, and how every sentence is
                                crafted.
                                Some stories make me smile. Some make me cry. Some stay with me long after I close the
                                book.

                                <br><br>

                                Another big part of my free time is <b>watching movies and series</b>.
                                I don’t just watch them for entertainment — I watch them for story, structure, and
                                emotion.

                                <br><br>

                                I love seeing how directors build tension,
                                how actors bring characters to life,
                                and how music, visuals, and dialogues come together to create impact.

                                <br><br>

                                Sometimes movies make me laugh.
                                Sometimes they make me think.
                                Sometimes they remind me of things I never noticed about people and relationships.

                                <br><br>

                                They help me understand behavior, decisions, mistakes — and growth.
                                In a way, cinema becomes another form of storytelling, just like poetry and books,
                                but with sound, expression, and visuals layered in.

                                <br><br>

                                Beyond creativity, I also have a strong curiosity for <b>technology</b>.
                                Not from a purely technical perspective — but from a human one.

                                <br><br>

                                I love discovering how new tools, apps, AI systems, and digital platforms change
                                everyday life:
                                how people use them,
                                how they affect communication,
                                and how they shape habits and opportunities.

                                <br><br>

                                I enjoy watching explainers, reading articles, and learning how modern systems work
                                behind the scenes.
                                Understanding technology gives me confidence — it makes me feel prepared for the future
                                instead of
                                overwhelmed by it.

                                <br><br>

                                But I also believe in balance.
                                I spend time reflecting quietly, journaling thoughts, organizing my ideas,
                                and simply taking pauses when life gets too loud.

                                <br><br>

                                I like moments where I can sit peacefully, listen to music,
                                or walk without thinking too much — because even silence can teach a lot.

                                <br><br>

                                Together, my hobbies — <b>poetry, reading, movies, and learning about technology</b> —
                                have shaped how I think and who I am becoming.

                                <br><br>

                                They help me stay creative.
                                They remind me to stay curious.
                                They keep me grounded when things feel uncertain.

                                <br><br>

                                Most importantly, they teach me that growth doesn’t always come loudly.
                                Sometimes it comes quietly — through stories, words, ideas, and gentle moments of
                                understanding.

                                <br><br>

                                I see my hobbies as companions on my journey — guiding me,
                                inspiring me, and constantly reminding me to explore,
                                feel, learn, and evolve.

                                My journey so far has been about understanding how ideas turn into working systems.
                                I’ve worked on several team-based concepts where clarity, design thinking,
                                and communication mattered just as much as code.

                                <br><br>

                                I focus strongly on:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Turning raw ideas into structured plans</li>
                                <li>Designing interfaces that feel natural, not forced</li>
                                <li>Helping teams stay calm, focused, and confident</li>
                                <li>Breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable parts</li>
                            </ul>

                            <br>

                            I’m comfortable collaborating across:

                            <b>
                                HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, documentation writing,
                                user testing, presentation decks, research summaries,
                                and feedback loops.
                            </b>

                            <br><br>

                            I’ve also learned to stay composed when timelines feel stressful.
                            My natural strength is staying <b>organized, supportive, and clear</b>
                            — especially when others feel overwhelmed.

                            <br><br>

                            For me, teamwork is not about who leads — it’s about whether everyone
                            understands the vision and feels confident contributing toward it.

                            </ul>

                            I enjoy experimenting, testing, improving, and repeating —
                            instead of rushing just to “finish” something.

                            <br><br>

                            My approach is simple:
                            <b>start small, improve consistently, and polish until it feels right.</b>

                            <br><br>

                            More projects are on the way — because each one teaches something new.
